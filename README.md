5 Days of Weather
========================

This is a simple weather application I created for my CS2803 class at Georgia Tech to learn the basics of PHP, MySQL, and AJAX. The app allows a user to create an account with a first and last name, password, email address, favorite city, and favorite color. Once a user creates an account, a personalized message appears on the page, and a 5 day weather forecast for the city they selected also appears. Users who have already created an account can also sign in using their previously created account and see the same functionality.


### Technologies Used 
* HTML
* CSS 
* JavaScript 
* PHP
